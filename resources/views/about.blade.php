      <p class="h3">Greetings and welcome to Midland City!</p>
      <p>I'd like to take a moment to share with you what Midland City is and how you can make the most of your time here. First of all, Midland has nothing to do with the old Silk Road or any other market that used that brand to promote itself. We use the Silk road theme only to rescue <strong>Ross Ulbricht</strong> values ​​and fight for what he and we believe is right.</p>
      <p>You may be shocked to find listings here that are outlawed in your jurisdiction. That doesn't mean Midland City is lawless. In fact, we have a very strict code of conduct that, if given a chance, most people I think would agree with. Our basic rules are to treat others as you would wish to be treated, mind your own business, and don't do anything to hurt or scam someone else. In the spirit of those rules, there are some things you will never see here, and if you do please report them. They include child pornography, stolen goods, assassinations and stolen personal information, just to name a few. We also hold our members to the highest standards of personal conduct and work tirelessly to prevent, root out and stop any scammers that may try to prey upon others.</p>
      <p>However, the best way to stay safe and make sure your experiences here are enjoyable is to educate yourself on how Midland City works, and take advantage of all the tools and guidelines we have made for you. A link to a complete guide can be found on your account page, but here are a few tips to get you started:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <strong>Always use the escrow system!</strong> This can't be stressed enough. 99% of scams are from people who set up fake vendor accounts and ask buyers to pay them directly or release payment before their order arrives. This behavior should be reported immediately. If you do choose to do this, we will be completely unable to help you in the event of fraud.
         </li>
         <li>
            <strong>Read the forum and the wiki.</strong> They contain a wealth of information and many in our forum community are eager to help a new member with a respectful attitude.
         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Start small.</b> Do a few small trades until you are comfortable with the process before throwing all of your Moneros at a big purchase.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The old saying, “with freedom comes responsibility,” couldn't be more true here. You will find easy access to things that could get you in trouble with your authorities and are downright terrible for your health. So, just because you can, doesn't mean you should. However, I'm not your daddy and it's your job to judge what is good and bad for you. No one else can do that.</p>
      <p>Stay safe, have fun, and come say hi on the forums!</p>
